A.
There have two code: fork-and-thread.c and fork-and-thread-without-semaphor.c
After complie and run both codes, we can see that if we don't add a semaphore, it shows error
(Segmentatiom fault (core dumped)). 
1) So we need to add a semaphore to protect the memory object.
2) And there are not deadlock condition with this solution.

B.
For complie this code, you need enter -> gcc -o shm-thread shm-thread.c -lpthread -lrt, 
then enter -> ./shm-thread to run code.
1) This solution does not require a mutex or semaphore.
2) The producer and consumer threads can write to the file at the same time
